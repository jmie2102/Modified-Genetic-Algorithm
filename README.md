A simple genetic algorithm (GA) was chosen to solve a 1-D bin packing problem. 
Adjustments have been made to certain aspects of the simple GA, including the crossover and mutation operators, aiming to enhance the optimal solution and overall efficiency. 
Additionally, the result of the modified algorithms is compared to the Simple Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Simple Hill Climber.

The main code is available in Simple Genetic Algorithm for BPP.ipynb

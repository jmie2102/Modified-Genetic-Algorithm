A simple genetic algorithm (GA) was chosen to solve a 1-D bin packing problem. 
Adjustments have been made to certain aspects of the simple GA, including the crossover and mutation operators, aiming to enhance the optimal solution and overall efficiency. 
Additionally, the result of the modified algorithms is compared to the Simple Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Simple Hill Climber.

Methodology
Simple Genetic Algorithm
A first-fit algorithm was implemented to generate the initial population for solving the 1-D bin packing problem. The algorithm places an item in the first bin from the existing collection of bins where the item can fit. This is a suitable approach for initializing the population as it can produce good initial solutions relatively quickly. While these initial solutions may not be close to the optimal solution, they act as a good starting point for the population by minimizing the number of bins used as much as possible. Additionally, the list of items is shuffled for each individual in the population to ensure uniqueness.
In the context of bin packing, where 'n' number of items are present in a bin, unique positive integer bin numbers are used to represent the genes for making changes to the individual. Any operations are performed at the bin (group) level (Falkenauer, 1996). A 2-point crossover was applied to the selected parents. The two crossover points were randomly chosen, and the genes between these crossover sections were extracted from one parent and injected into another to create a new individual. Furthermore, any duplicates of the original items are removed before the extracted crossover section can be injected into another parent. The parents are then replaced by their offspring to form a new population.
Mutation plays a major role in introducing more exploration to the solution rather than exploiting whatever is known to be good. To perform a mutation operation on the offspring, a random gene is selected, and subsequently eliminated; this means a random bin is selected and discarded from the solution. Once the bin has been discarded, the items within those bins are reassigned to any bin. Therefore, these items are placed back into the existing bins using the first-fit approach (Falkenauer, 1996). This method is derived from Falkenauer’s work on the hybrid grouping genetic algorithm.

Modified Simple Genetic Algorithm
The objective of these modifications is to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation, maintaining fitness and diversity within the population (MIT OpenCourseWare, 2014). This entails preserving the fittest individuals while also diversifying the population. The concept of balancing fitness versus diversity is vital in the pursuit of an optimal solution. Ensuring the continuation of the fittest individuals into the next generation contributes to stability, while introducing new and diverse solutions promotes exploration of the search space, potentially leading to the discovery of a global optimum.
Firstly, random bin assignment is applied to fit the items into the bins to generate the initial population. A random item is selected from the list of items, and the algorithm attempts to place the item into a randomly chosen bin. If the item does not fit in the bin, then a new bin is opened. Although this may result in a larger number of bins overall compared to the first-fit approach, this is the beginning of introducing exploration. It allows the initial solution to explore the search landscape more, ensuring the presence of diverse individuals initially.
For the parent selection process, the roulette wheel approach was implemented to choose parents from the population. With the roulette wheel approach, individuals with higher fitness scores have a greater likelihood of being selected for crossover, while those with lower fitness scores have a reduced probability. The probability is determined by dividing an individual's fitness score by the sum of the population's fitness scores. This approach ensures that individuals with higher probabilities are more likely to be chosen, but those with lower fitness scores still have a chance of being selected with a very low probability. This ensures that not only the fittest individuals are chosen for recombination, but also allows a slight chance for individuals with low fitness to be selected, potentially contributing to producing new solutions and achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration.
The crossover operation was modified to randomly select the crossover section to be extracted from one parent and injected into another. With 2 crossover points, 3 crossover sections are formed. The first section comprises the genes between the first gene and the first randomly selected crossover point, the second section comprises the genes between the first and the second crossover point, and the third section comprises the genes between the second crossover point and the last gene. Each of these crossover sections contains a unique set of genes. However, by selecting only the middle section (second section), the other sections of genes are missed out on for recombination in each instance. Therefore, a modification was made to the crossover function to randomly select the crossover section. This ensures that genes from different sections can also be used for recombination, leading to the formation of completely unique solutions and encouraging more exploration of the search landscape.
Incorporating the concept of an adaptive mutation rate based on an individual’s fitness and the average population’s fitness (Marsili Libelli and Alba, 2000) could further fortify the equilibrium between preserving the fittest individuals and generating a new diverse set of individuals. The mutation rate of an individual's genes is adjusted based on whether the fitness of the individual is lower or higher than the average fitness of the population. If the fitness surpasses the average population’s fitness, indicating efficient item packing, the genes in this individual should not undergo significant mutation or have a very low mutation rate. Conversely, if the fitness is equal to or less than the average population’s fitness, then the genes of the individual should undergo a higher mutation rate to ensure diversity, enriching the population with more unique individuals.
Moreover, as not all individuals are chosen for recombination, those not selected as parents undergo a random probability test to determine whether their fitness is greater or lesser than the average fitness of the population. If the fitness exceeds the average fitness, the individual is assigned a very low probability of mutation; otherwise, the probability of mutation is extremely high.
Finally, to guarantee the continuation of the fittest individual from the current population into the next generation, the concept of elitism is employed. Several individuals with the highest fitness scores are preserved within the population. This practice ensures the retention of the best set of individuals found in each generation, ensuring that regardless of the outcome in each generation, the fittest individual from the previous generation is always maintained to guide the search.
All of these modifications contribute to reinforcing the concept of balance between fitness and diversity. Maintaining the fittest individual is as crucial as producing diverse and unique individuals. This ensures not only that the search is guided in the right direction but also prevents it from getting stuck in a local optimum.

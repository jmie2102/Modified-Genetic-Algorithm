Simple genetic algorithm (GA) was chosen to solve a 1-D bin packing problem. 
Adjustments has been made to certrain aspects of the simple GA, including the crossover and mutation operators, aiming to enhance the optimal solution and overall efficiency. 
Additionally, the result of the modified algorithms is compared to the Simple Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Simple Hill Climber.
